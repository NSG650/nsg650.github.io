            <h1>XNU on the Raspberry Pi [Part 2]</h1>
            <h4>Posted on 20-12-2023</h4>
            <div>
                <p>This is in continuation of my <a href="8-7-2023.html">previous</a> blog post about trying to get the XNU kernel running on the Raspberry Pi 3.</p>
            <div>
            <div>
                <h2>Short recap</h2>
                <p>In my previous blog post, I had modified the bootloader limine to load and run the Mach-O XNU kernel but later on in the kernel <code>wfe_timeout_init</code> would fail.</p>
                <p>I decided to patch those instructions out and continue execution but it kept failing usually in stages where it involved reading the device tree such as <code>ml_parse_cpu_topology</code>.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Looking up online again</h2>
                <p>I decided to look up more attempts of other people trying to get XNU running on the BCM2837. I stumbled across <a href="https://github.com/FlorentRevest/u-boot">this</a> fork of u boot and decided to try it out.</p>
                <p>I built the u-boot fork and ran it under qemu and it worked so much better.</p>
                <p>The kernel made it through the functions that it was failing before such as <code>ml_parse_cpu_topology</code>. However it crashed right after <code>arm_vm_init</code>.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Figuring out the crash</h2>
                <p>The crash occurred later on when it tried accessing the device tree again.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 70%">

                    The kernel crashes at SecureDTLookupEntry
                </p>
                <p>After looking around a bit in the kernel and how the page tables were setup the patch was relatively simple.</p>
                <pre>      
    // in osfmk/arm64/arm_vm_init.c:2070

            arm_vm_map(cpu_tte, cur, ARM_PTE_EMPTY);
        }
    #endif    
        PE_slide_devicetree(gVirtBase - gPhysBase); // Added because the 1:1 physical mappings are gone and 
                                                        // we don't want to continue accessing those old addresses    
        pmap_bootstrap(dynamic_memory_begin);    
        disable_preemption();    
        /*
         * Initialize l3 page table pages :

                <h2>Running it!</h2>
                <p>After the patch and recompiling the kernel it worked. It made it to the UART initialization and I was able to view the kernel messages!</p>

                <p>Now that it worked under qemu I decided to test on real hardware</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Real hardware testing.</h2>
                <p>I decided to try it out on my Raspberry Pi 3 B+. Since my Raspberry Pi had a broken sd card slot I decided to USB boot it. Preparing the USB was easy.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 70%">
                    <img src="assets/20-12-2023/contents_of_the_usb.png" alt="Files on the USB."><br>
                    Files on the USB.
                </p>
                <p>I copied over the kernel and the dtb used along with the dtb for u-boot, bootcode.bin, start.elf, the u-boot binary and a basic config.txt file. The content of the config file is the following.</p>
                <pre>

   kernel=u-boot.bin
   arm_64bit=1
   device_tree=bcm2710-rpi-3-b-plus.dtb                  
                </pre>
                <p>Next thing was wiring up the appropriate GPIO pins for UART on the Pi. XNU sets up GPIO Pin 14, 15 on the Pi for UART.</p>
                <p>Here is a little trick, If you don't have a UART to USB adapter on hand you can use an existing microcontroller board. Make sure it's operating voltage matches the device you are trying to debug.</p> 
                <p>For the microcontroller board just disable the chip itself. Usually this involves setting the reset pin to ground (on Arduinos) or setting the enable pin to ground (on ESP8266/32 which is what I was using for this).</p>  
                <p>Then simply wire up the TX on the Pi to RX on the microcontroller board (or TX in my case since the labeling was incorrect on the board :P).</p>

                <h2>How do I get this up and running?</h2>
                <p>You need to build the u-boot fork and the XNU kernel or you can use the precompiled binaries over <a href="https://github.com/NSG650/nsg650.github.io/releases/tag/rpi-xnu">here</a>.</p>
                <div>
                    <h3>Building u-boot</h3>
                    <p>I cloned the <a href="https://github.com/FlorentRevest/u-boot">repo</a> and ran the following commands</p>
                    <pre>
    
    make clean; make mrproper; make distclean
    export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-elf-
    make rpi_3_defconfig
    make menuconfig
    make -j8
                    </pre>
                    <p>If you are building on linux it might fail to build. In such a case you have to revert <a href="https://github.com/FlorentRevest/u-boot/commit/b5b188ef69aa98885697c5e753cc2ea4c4e29777">this</a> commit.</p>
                    <p>In the menu config navigate to <code>Command line interface->Boot Commands</code> and enable <code>bootxnu</code> and save it.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 70%">
                        <img src="assets/20-12-2023/uboot_menu_config.png" alt="u-boot menu config with bootxnu option enabled"><br>
                        u-boot menu config with bootxnu option enabled
                    </p>
                    <p>After it is done building you should be left with a <code>u-boot.bin</code> file.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Building XNU</h3>
                    <p>The XNU kernel source used here is from chenguokai's writeup. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/chenguokai/chenguokai/releases/tag/xnu">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>Make sure to do a clean build. For the build steps I just followed <a href="https://kernelshaman.blogspot.com/2021/02/building-xnu-for-macos-112-intel-apple.html">this</a> guide.</p>
                    <p>Apply the patch I mentioned above and then build it using the following command.</p>
                    <pre>

    make SDKROOT=macosx ARCH_CONFIGS=arm64 MACHINE_CONFIGS=bcm2837 KERNEL_CONFIGS=development LOGCOLORS=y -j4
                    </pre>
                    <p>After it's done building you should be left with the <code>kernel.development.bcm2837</code> file</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Running it under qemu</h3>
                    <p>To run it under qemu, I made a simple virtual disk image, formatted as MBR FAT32 and copied over the kernel file and the rpi.dtb file. To run it, I used the following command.</p>
                    <pre>

    qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi3b -kernel u-boot.bin -serial file:/dev/stdout -serial file:/dev/stdout -serial file:/dev/stdout -usb \
    -device usb-mouse -device usb-kbd -drive file=test.img,if=sd,format=raw -m 1024
                    </pre>
                    <p>Once you drop to the u-boot shell run the following commands.</p>
                    <pre>

    load mmc 0 ${kernel_addr_r} kernel.bcm2837
    load mmc 0 ${fdt_addr_r} rpi.dtb
    env set bootargs "debug=0x8 kextlog=0xfff -noprogress"
                    </pre>
                    <p>Finally run the kernel with the command</p>
                    <pre>

    bootxnu ${kernel_addr_r} ${fdt_addr_r}
                    </pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>I was super happy that I managed to get XNU running on the Pi at last. In the end I did not get to use my own bootloader but did learn a bit about the XNU kernel which helped me in patching it and I managed to get XNU running further.</p>
                <p>Thank you so much for reading this blog post and Happy Holidays!</p>
