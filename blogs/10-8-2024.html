           <h4>Posted on 10-8-2024</h4>
           <div>
                <p>At the start of this year, I stumbled across this weird driver. I
                    decided to throw it into IDA and found out that it is WinRing0 which
                    any limited user can access. The best (worst?) part? It was signed and
                    it can still be loaded. I decided to play around with it.</p>
           </div>
           <div>
              <h2>What is WinRing0?</h2>
              <p>From the <a href="https:github.com/GermanAizek/WinRing0">github repo</a>.  </p>
              <blockquote>
                WinRing0 is a hardware access library for Windows. <br>
                WinRing0 library allows x86/x64 Windows applications to access <br>
                -> I/O port <br>
                -> MSR (Model-Specific Register) <br>
                -> PCI <br>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Such drivers are popularly used among tools for overclocking tools for
                CPUs/GPUs, hardware control for things such as RGB on the
                motherboard/RAM, and tools that provide information about the system
                such as voltages, temperatures, etc.
                Digging into the code, I also found out that it allows access to
                reading and writing to the system's physical memory.
            </p>
               <p>
                The code does
                make use of <code>IoCreateDeviceSecure</code> which is good since such a driver
                should be used only by Administrators (I digress despite being
                Administrator only bypassing the OS' security mechanism should not be
                allowed at all).
              </p>

                <p>
                    However, the version I have does NOT make use of <code>IoCreateDeviceSecure</code>
                    but rather <code>IoCreateDevice</code> which means even limited users can access this driver!

            <h2>How can we exploit this?</h2>
                <p>
                    Initially I thought one could read the CR3 register (on x86_64 this
                    holds the physical address for the PML4 base) and manually find the
                    physical addresses for certain important variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, this driver does not provide any access to any CR registers so, we have to
                    go with the second approach which is scanning the entire memory
                    manually. In order to scan the memory, we need to know which memory
                    regions are valid and can be scanned. Fortunately, Windows provides a
                    registry key just for providing this information!
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h3>Fetching the memory map of the system</h3>
                    <p>Windows provides a registry key
                        <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\RESOURCEMAP\System Resources\Physical
                            Memory</code> which contains the physical memory map of the system. It also
                        provides reserved memory regions. These reserved regions are usually
                        used for hardware MMIO. We would not like to touch these regions so we
                        would skip over these regions. The funny thing is this registry key is
                        accessible to limited users as well. I wrote a basic program to print
                        out the memory map and used this in the exploit.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>What do we look for?</h3>
                    <p>I decided to look for the <code>EPROCESS</code> structures of a system process and
                        for the cmd.exe process. The <code>EPROCESS</code> structure contains various
                        information about the running process such as the name, creation time,
                        etc. We are interested in the token. A token specifies the security
                        context of the running thread or process, so, if we steal a system
                        process' token (let's say lsass.exe) and apply it to our process
                        (cmd.exe) then the process would have the security context of a system
                        process. We escalated the privileges. How do we look for the <code>EPROCESS</code>
                        structure in memory though?</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Pools</h3>
                    <p>In Windows, memory allocations in the kernel are made using the
                        <code>ExAllocatePool</code> family of functions. The pool address returned is 16
                        bytes aligned. These functions require a tag for the allocation. The
                        tag is a 4 byte character associated with the pool. Pool allocations
                        made for <code>EPROCESS</code> are done using the 'Proc' tag. So we can first start
                        by scanning the memory for 'Proc'.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 70%">
                            <img src="assets/10-8-2024/process_to_pool.png"><br>
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-size: 70%">
                            <img src="assets/10-8-2024/pool_virtual_to_physical.png"><br>
                        </p>
                        <p> However that is not enough to find <code>EPROCESS</code> structures in memory since
                            any random memory chunk can have 'Proc' but that does not make it an
                            actual pool. So, we need to check for other defining bytes which
                            proves it is a valid pool containing the <code>EPROCESS</code> structure.</p>
                        <p>
                            Thankfully I came across <a href="https://h0mbre.github.io/atillk64_exploit/">this</a> where it mentioned
                            a few magic bytes to be checked which also marked the start of the
                            actual <code>EPROCESS</code> structure. In this case the bytes were <code>\x03\x00\xb2\x00</code>.
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Stealing the token</h3>
                    <p>After checking the magic bytes, we can check if the name corresponds
                        to a system process such as lsass.exe, smss.exe, etc. or if its
                        cmd.exe. When we find either of these, we save the token's location in
                        physical memory. When we finally find both a system process and
                        cmd.exe's token locations, we break out of the loop. We copy the token
                        from the system process and finally write it into the cmd.exe</p>

                    <p>Here is a demo of the exploit running on a Windows Server 2012 R2
                        virtual machine with secure boot enabled to prove that indeed the
                        driver is signed and loaded by the system. The final exploit can be
                        found <a href="https://gist.github.com/NSG650/d718fcf5aa78a407783e3404d7b54128">here</a></p>

                    <h2>Regarding the setup</h2>
                    <p>In NT 10 there have been more restrictions imposed on what ranges can
                        be and can not be mapped. There is also the introduction of
                        <code>MiShowBadMapper</code> which prevents such "scanning" of memory from taking
                        place. There are probably techniques which allow one to bypass these
                        and scan the entire system memory but since I was busy and had other
                        work to do so I decided to spin up a Windows Server 2012 R2 virtual
                        machine, update it and do all the testing under that. My main goal was to show
                        that the driver exposed such interfaces which allows for these
                        exploits.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Even if you find a signed driver, it doesn't mean the driver is going
                        to be safe. There have been cases of such drivers being signed and
                        shipped in products. I believe there should be stricter processes on
                        how these drivers are signed. Microsoft should also revoke signatures
                        for drivers for products that are no longer in development. This
                        minimizes the number of exploited drivers or crashes caused due to
                        silly issues such as the CrowdStrike incident.
                        This driver was included with <a href="https://www.evga.com/precisionxoc/">EVGA's Precision XOC</a> software which is no longer
                        in development but the driver included is still signed and valid.
