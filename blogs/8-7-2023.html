           <h1>XNU on the Raspberry Pi [Part 1]</h1>
           <h4>Posted on 8-7-2023</h4>
           <div>
                <p>The XNU kernel runs on most Apple devices. It is the kernel used in macOS and iOS. 
                <p>This blog post is a write up of my attempts at trying to run it on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+.</p>
           </div>
           <div>
                <h2>How?</h2>
                <p>The XNU kernel has a build target for the BCM2837 since <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-4903.221.2/pexpert/pexpert/arm64/BCM2837.h.auto.html">2016</a></p>
                <p>There have been attempts before at
                    building and running the kernel but I have never come across someone
                    running it on an actual Raspberry Pi with UART output.</p>
           </div>
           <div>
                <h2>Building the kernel</h2>
                <p>I knew I had to make some patches to the kernel for it to build and
                    run it on the BCM2837. A quick google search yielded a guide from <a href="https://github.com/Inokinoki/xnu-bcm2837-hackintosh/blob/master/Build/XNU-7195.81.3.md">Inokinoki</a>. Following the guide I was able to build a
                    kernel.</p>

                        Screenshot of information about the kernel I built
                    </p>

                    <p>Now that I had built the kernel I had to run it, so I had to write a
                        bootloader for it.</p>
           </div>
           <div>
                <h2>Bootloader</h2>
                <p>For the bootloader I decided to work on an existing bootloader. I
                    decided to work on <a href="https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine">Limine</a> since I have
                    used and modified this bootloader for some private projects earlier
                    and I really like it. At the time of working on the project the latest
                    version was <code>limine-4.20230330.0</code></p>

                <p>Mach-O is the executable format used by XNU. I had never worked with
                    this file format before but thanks to the tool
                    <a href="https://github.com/horsicq/XMachOViewer/">XMachOViewer</a> along with
                    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aidansteele/osx-abi-macho-file-format-reference/master/Mach-O_File_Format.pdf">Apple's documentation for
                        Mach-O</a> I was able to
                    understand the file format and came up with the following Mach-O
                    loader.</p>
                    <pre>

    struct macho_header *header = (struct macho_header *)kernel;
    // Checks if it is a Mach-O file
    if (header->magic != 0xfeedfacf) {
        return;
    }
    // Some architecture specific checks go here 
    // ...
    // Check if the Mach-O given is executable or not
    if (header->file_type != 0x2) {
        return;
    }
    uint8_t *sect_ptr = kernel + sizeof(struct macho_header);
    uint64_t entry_point = 0;
    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < header->command_count; i++) {
        struct load_command *lc = (struct load_command *)sect_ptr;
        if (lc->cmd == 0x19) { // LC_SECTION64
            struct segment_command_64 *sc64 = (struct segment_command_64 *)lc;
            // Example function that would map physical to virtual memory
            memory_map(sc64->vmaddr, kernel + sc64->fileoff, sc64->vmsize);
        } 
        if (lc->cmd == 0x5) { // LC_UNIXTHREAD
            struct thread_command *tc = (struct thread_command *)lc;
            // This too is architecture specific
            entry_point = tc->state.pc;
        }
        sect_ptr += lc->cmdsize;
    }
    if (entry_point == 0) return;
    printf("Entry point at %p\n", entry_point);
                    </pre>
                    <p style="font-size: 70%">Note: This is is mostly pseudocode and function names won't match with the one present in my code</p>
           </div>
           <div>
                <h2>Running and debugging it</h2>
                <p>Of course things don't work always at first try and I found out that I
                    need not map the memory already. The kernel would map the memory
                    itself.</p>

                <p>I took a look at <a href="https://github.com/zhuowei/qemu">zhuowei's qemu fork</a> and found that I had to load
                    everything in a single contiguous block of memory.</p>

                <p>So I had to parse the file twice. Once to get the lowest and highest
                    virtual address and the second time to actually copy the segments of
                    the kernel. The size is calculated by subtracting the highest and
                    lowest virtual address. After this I passed in the physical address
                    for the loaded kernel and the lowest virtual address.</p>

                <p>Did it work? Nope!</p>
                <p style="font-size: 70%">

                    XNU failing to jump to arm_init
                </p>

                <p>The kernel failed to jump to the virtual address of arm_init with a
                    prefetch abort which implied the page tables were not set up
                    correctly.</p>

                <p>After talking to Inokinoki I found out that <a href="https://github.com/chenguokai/chenguokai/blob/master/writeup_xnu_bcm2837.md">chenguokai</a> had actually managed to build and run the kernel
                    under qemu.</p>
                
                <p>Reading his writeup I found out that more patches had to be made to
                    the kernel in order to get it booting such as configuring the kernel
                    to make use of 4KB pages instead of 16KB pages. I decided to use his
                    kernel build since it was a working one. Did that work? Kinda.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 70%">

                    Jumping else where in memory
                </p>

                <p>
                    The kernel jumped to a virtual address but it was not <code>arm_init</code>. So what went wrong? Apparently the virtual address parameter is
                    <code>0xfffffff000000000 + physical address</code> which is why it jumped somewhere else in memory and failed to boot.
                </p>

                    It jumped to arm_init!
                </p>

                <p>Making the changes it actually made it to <code>arm_init</code>! It still crashes.
Why? It is failing to read the DTB! The DTB format used by XNU is different from the one used in Linux so I just grabbed whatever chenguokai used</p>

                <p style="font-size: 70%">

                </p>

                <p>The address for the DTB too should be a virtual address. This is how
                    the memory map ended up looking along with the boot arguments.</p>

                <p>
                    After all these changes, it made it to the function <code>wfe_timeout_init</code>
                    where it called <code>panic</code>. I really wanted some UART outputs but the
                    kernel crashes before the UART Initialisation part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am really unsure how the same kernel works on chenguokai's qemu fork
                    despite the only change being made was the addition of the Mach-O
                    Loader along with EL2 and EL3 being removed. Again in my bootloader it
                    would first switch to EL1 then jump to the kernel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would really appreciate some help in getting further. It could be me
                    making a goofy mistake somewhere. I will work on the project later on.
                    Probably when I could come up with a possible reason why it failed or
                    someone points out the mistakes I made.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>I learnt alot about XNU and ARM64 through this project. I however need
                    to learn more to reach the end goal of XNU outputting something on the
                    Raspberry Pi. You can find my work in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/NSG650/16b61d8db84cbc48588da4b7130beb83">GitHub

                <p>Thank you for reading this blog post and please contact me if you can
                    help me.</p>
