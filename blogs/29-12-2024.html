            <h4>Posted on 29-12-2024</h4>
            <div>
                <p>I've always wanted to learn about bootkits and write one. This blog
                    explains what bootkits are and how the one we wrote works.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Bootkits</h2>
                <p>A bootkit is a type of malware that infects the system during the boot
                    process, usually being loaded before the bootloader, allowing it to
                    patch or hook anything ahead of it. In this case, our goal is to patch
                    the Windows kernel, <code>ntoskrnl.exe</code>. Bootkits are inherently subtle,
                    making them very difficult to detect and by effect making it much
                    harder for anti-virus software to detect them or what changes they
                    might have made to the system.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>UEFI</h2>
                <p>The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), created to replace
                    BIOS, acts as an interface between the operating system and the
                    firmware, providing a standard environment for bootloaders or pre-boot
                    applications.</p>

                <p>UEFI applications, such as bootloaders or drivers, are Portable
                    Executables (PEs) stored on a FAT32 partition and loaded by the
                    firmware during startup. While UEFI applications and drivers are
                    similar, they differ in key ways. UEFI applications run once and are
                    unloaded from memory after exiting, whereas UEFI drivers remain in
                    memory even after the operating system is initialized.</p>

                <p>UEFI exposes two types of services. Boot Services and Runtime
                    Services.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Boot Services</h3>
                    <p>Boot services are functions available only before the operating system
                        is initialized. Once <code>ExitBootServices</code> is called, these services become
                        inaccessible. They include operations such as retrieving the system's
                        memory map, accessing the Graphics Output Protocol (GOP), and more.
                        Due to their one time only availability, boot services are primarily
                        used by UEFI applications like bootloaders.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Runtime Services</h3>
                    <p>Runtime services are functions that remain accessible even after the
                        operating system has fully initialized. These services include tasks
                        like getting or setting the system time, shutting down or resetting
                        the system, and accessing the firmware's environment variables. Unlike
                        boot services, runtime services remain available after
                        <code>ExitBootServices</code> is called, making them particularly useful for UEFI
                        drivers that need to interact with the OS.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Where do we begin?</h2>
                <p>Our goal is to gain control during the system's boot process, so we'd
                    like to hook into the bootloader itself. Looking for the bootloader in
                    memory and patching it to call a hook is tedious. Luckily there's a
                    better way. We can hook <code>ExitBootServices</code>.</p>
                <div>
                    <h3><code>ExitBootServices</code></h3>
                    <p>ExitBootServices is a function called by the bootloader just before
                        transferring control to the operating system. At this point, the
                        kernel and all necessary dependencies are loaded into memory and ready
                        to execute. The bootloader's only remaining task is to hand control
                        over to the kernel and pass the <code>LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK</code>.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 70%">
                        <img src="assets/29-12-2024/winload_calling_ExitBootServices.png" alt="Winload calling ExitBootServices just before giving control to the kernel"><br>

                    </p>
                    <p>Hooking <code>ExitBootServices</code> is simple. We disable write protection, 
                        overwrite the function pointer to <code>ExitBootServices</code> in the global Boot Services object
                         and then re-enable write protection.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 70%">

                        Hooking ExitBootServices
                    </p>
                    <p>The hook function is minimal and only captures the return address of the caller which points to inside <code>OslFwpKernelSetupPhase1</code>. 
                        Afterward, it calls the original <code>ExitBootServices</code> to continue the boot process.</p>

                    <p>We go through <code>winload.efi</code> and use a move signature to obtain the pointer to the <code>LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK</code>. However, we encountered an issue,
                         attempting to access the <code>LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK</code> results in a crash because we have not switched to the correct address space used by NT.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3><code>EVT_SIGNAL_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS_CHANGE</code></h3>
                    <p>Our next step in the bootkit involves registering a handler function in the driver entry, which is triggered when the event is raised.
                         This event occurs once the new address space is set up, giving us access to both the <code>LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK</code> and the kernel. 
                         To locate the <code>LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK</code>, we move our search code into the handler and use the same load signature mentioned earlier.
                         Once we have the <code>LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK</code>, we parse it to find <code>ntoskrnl.exe</code> and extract its base address.</p>

                <h2>Patching the kernel</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that we have the kernel base, we can scan the kernel to find any function and modify it as needed.
                    In this case, our goal is to patch a function called early in the boot process. One such function, <code>IoInitSystem</code>, stands out as an ideal target. 
                    The part we hook is just called after the core system drivers like the file system, ACPI, etc. are loaded but just before any boot drivers are loaded.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 70%">
                    <img src="assets/29-12-2024/Original_IoInitSystem.png" alt="Disassembly of the original IoInitSystem function"><br>

                </p>
                <p>
                    By performing another signature search, we locate the address of <code>IoInitSystem</code>, where we patch in a retpoline jump. 
                    The patching process works as follows
                </p>
                <p>-> First, we copy the original code from the function.</p>
                <p>-> Next, we prepare the shellcode for the retpoline as follows</p>
                <pre>

    mov  r10, IoInitSystem
    push r10 ; Keep the original as our return address
    mov  r10, IoinitSystemHook
    jmp  r10                    
                </pre>
                <p>At the end of the hook function, we restore the original code, and since the last address on the stack is the original function, 
                    when we return execution continues as normal.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 70%">

                </p>
                <p>Since our hook function resides in our UEFI driver, we have to make use of <code>ConvertPointer</code> to get an address that is in the address space utilized by NT.</p>
                <p>Once inside the hook function, we have control as the kernel. We can parse the kernel's <code>IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY</code> to find function addresses giving us the ability to use any NT function.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    We (<a href="https://github.com/NSG650">NSG650</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Pdawg-bytes">Pdawg</a>) learnt a lot about UEFI and the Windows boot process through this. 
                    It also reminds us about how scary and powerful these types of malware are and why security measures like Secure Boot are put into place.
